/**
 * Event Bus Challenge
 * 
 * 1. The goal is to build a very simple PubSub/event emitter in Javascript. 
 *    We will create an eventEmitter object and then we'll subscribe to events and trigger them. 
 *    Subscribing to an event simply adds a callback to be run when the event is triggered. 
 *    Triggering an event (emit) should run all the attached callbacks.
 * 2. Don't overthink it. The solution should only take a few minutes and a few lines of code. 
 *    Build only what you need to get the desired ouput.
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 1. Although we only use error/success events, please build the class to handle arbitrary events.
 * 2. Events data will always be an object.
 * 3. A callback should always be safe to call.
